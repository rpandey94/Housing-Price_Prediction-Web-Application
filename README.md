# California Housing Price Prediction Web Application On Heroku

The deployed web app is live at https://house-price-prediction-webapp.herokuapp.com/

This web app predicts the median house price within a block based on the features of a block like (population, households, total rooms, total bedrooms).
I have also added geo-maps so that you can understand the difference in predicted house prices based on their location, and choose your own block to generate predictions.

The web app was built in Python using the following libraries:

streamlit
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
pickle
