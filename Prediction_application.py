## Column Descriptions

1. longitude: A measure of how far west a house is; a higher value is farther west

2. latitude: A measure of how far north a house is; a higher value is farther north

3. housing_median_age: Median age of a house within a block; a lower number is a newer building

4. total_rooms: Total number of rooms within a block

5. total_bedrooms: Total number of bedrooms within a block

6. population: Total number of people residing within a block

7. households: Total number of households, a group of people residing within a home unit, for a block

8. median_income: Median income for households within a block of houses (measured in tens of thousands of US Dollars)

9. median_house_value: Median house value for households within a block (measured in US Dollars)
